# lngr

This library provides functions for lexing and parsing a grammar based on a definition file (see [sample_grammar.json](https://github.com/dodgez/lngr/blob/master/README.md)).

Currently a lexer is functional, but the parser is yet to come.
Eventually, the grammar specification will be lexed and parsed using this library.
