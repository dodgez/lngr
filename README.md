# lngr

This library provides functions for lexing and parsing a grammar based on a definition file (see [sample_grammar.json](https://github.com/dodgez/lngr/blob/master/README.md)).

Currently a lexer and parser are functional.
The parser doesn't support anything other than basic reference to other rules and tokens.
Eventually, the grammar specification will be lexed and parsed using this library.
